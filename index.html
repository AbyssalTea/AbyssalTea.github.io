      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a graduate from the University of Wisconsin Madison, with Bachelor's in both Computer Engineering & Computer Science and certificates in both Game Design and German. 
			I have hands-on experience in software developement, IT Support, and team leadership. 
			I love designing and building games and interactive projects that are both functional and engaging. 
			Whether focusing on public or personal projects, I aim to create games and tools that are intuitive, impactful, and fun to play.</p>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>The Floor is Confusing</h4>
					<p>My first time working with VR in Unity, developed over three months with a team of four. 
					The only way to move is by slingshotting the player in an arc — which made level design both fun and frustrating. 
					I handled level layouts, respawning, checkpoint mechanics, and plenty of bug squashing.</p>
					<p><strong>Engine:</strong> Unity</p>
				</div>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>Fleeing Footsteps</h4>
					<p>Made in two weeks as a personal challenge to blend Horror and Clicker genres in p5.js.
					The player has to alternate pressing the left and right arrow keys while a looming threat follows close behind.</p>
					<p><strong>Engine:</strong> p5.js & html</p>

				</div>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>Runic Ruin</h4>
					<p>My first try with PuzzleScript, which is mainly a puzzle engine, but I wanted to push it into story territory too. 
					The biggest challenge I faced was splitting the game into two main areas: one where the player walks around, and another where puzzles are disguised as writing sigils in a book.</p>
					<p><strong>Engine:</strong> Puzzlescript</p>

				</div>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>Sleepless Shepherd</h4>
					<p>Built in about a week with the theme of making a “serious game.” 
					I went with a sleep insomnia rhythm game where players count sheep crossing the screen while random distractions try to mess up their timing.</p>
					<p><strong>Engine:</strong> p5.js & html</p>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>Past Packages</h4>
					<p>Made in Maya over a month for a theme of Protection and Change. 
					I modeled real-world items from my own life, animated them being packed into a box, had the box travel through different scenes, and slowly become battered to show the passage of time.</p>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>Practicing Pyromancer</h4>
					<p>This was my way of practicing nParticles and nMesh in Maya while also pushing myself to model and animate a character. 
					The mage draws a fire symbol in a book, the fire appears, they quickly put it out, and flip the page, which allows the whole thing to loop seamlessly.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>RenderCeption</h4>
					<p>My first time using Maya’s animation tools. I recreated my own workstation, and created a fake Maya scene running inside the computer. 
					The camera moves around to show how perspective can hide or expose weird modeling mistakes.</p>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>A Darkening World</h4>
					<p>My first big Maya project where I took the theme of a vanitas and used it to recreate the bad ending of OneShot, which I’d just finished playing at the time.</p>

				<div class="project">
					<h4>Robot Character Study</h4>
					<p>Part of a class assignment focused on design. 
					I mashed together real-world tech: running blades like legs, Wall-E–inspired hands, camera-like eyes, and an old satellite dish my family used to have. 
					I even did a simple rig and dropped it into a scene from a past project for an extra render.</p>
